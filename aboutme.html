          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>In my personal life I am working toward being the best person I can be. In my professional life I am working towards being a maintenance technician for Arthrex.

I am working toward these goals by always doing the right thing and being grateful for what I have that some people don't.

The values I consider most necessary for my success is having a strong mentality, happiness, and acceptance. You cant really do a lot when your weak minded and you have no motivation. Happiness is always better than having attitude or hating everything in your life. And acceptance is realizing that in life there are some situations that you don't have control of and don't have an effect on the outcome.

Short-term goals that I hope to achieve in the future is graduating high school. I want to continue averaging A's and B's the rest of my senior year. I would also like to win a state championship with my football team because without the players, the coaches, and just the sport I don't know what I would be doing right now.

Some character traits I would like to be known for is always being determined but also always being a happy and fun person. </p>
